Hi there, this is Amy Huang. I just completed my master degree in Statistics in 2018. My interest in data science and passion for life drive me to where I am today. Now I am working as a machine learing engineer in Taiwan. I have done several projects on analyzing data, predicting trend, and generating a solution. Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/wantinghuang) if you are interested.
