Hi there, it is Wan-Ting Huang, written as 黃婉婷 in Chinese.
I just completed my master degree in Statistics in 2018. I am particularly interested in data science. Now I am working as a machine learing engineer at Taiwan. I have done several projects on analyzing data, predicting trend, and generating a solution. If you are looking for someone with a passion for science to join your team, contact me.
